# iiif-static-choices
A IIIF static tile and manifest generator built using Python to generate IIIF tiled images and manifests.  This application was put together to de-mystify the process of creating and hosting IIIF content and allow implementations without the need for specialist infrastructure such as imaging servers (iip) and manifest servers.
